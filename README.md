# Job Search Organizer using React/Redux - Express/NodeJS - sqlite3

## Aim

The application [**Job Search Organizer**](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois/projects_with_sql/tree/master/react-redux/job_search_react_redux_mysql) is working the exact same way, but instead of using an independent database (**MySQL**), we are using an ***embbed*** database which is **sqlite3**

## Why?

|   | **MySQL**  | **sqlite3**  |
|---|---|---|
| **advantages**  | * Big size database<br />   * Better with complexe requests | * Very fast for small and medium size database<br />  * No need to start any database |
| **disavantage**  | * Need to start the database<br />   * .... | * Limited on size of the database<br />   * Could have problems with complex requests ...<br />   * ....  |



### Executing

I - **Server**: start your server in your [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on the same folder of your [**server.js**](./server.js) file. Enter the command

> npm install

to install the dependencies. Following by to start the ***server***:

> npm run build

II - **Client** - Open your favorite Internet Brower (**Chrome**, **Firefox**, **IE**, etc.) and enter in the address bar

> localhost:3000
